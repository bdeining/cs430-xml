To run this program, you must update your classpath to include the mysql JDBC connector jar and have the Libdata.xml file
in the same director this program is compiled and ran from.

This can be done by adding the following to your ~/.bashrc file:
    export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar"

Compile by using the following command
    javac Lab4.java

Run the program with the following command
    java Lab4 username password

The program will use the given username as the database name, since this is the structure on Faure.
